</details>
<p>
This is the first update of our jpackaged "Easy-Install" bundle for Windows.
In this update, the HTTPS Everywhere will begin to self-disable on recent versions of
Firefox. I2P in Private Browsing is updated to version 1.26.
NoScript is updated to 11.2.11. The jpackaged I2P Router was built with Adoptium JDK 17
and I2P version 1.5.1, which is a branch of 1.5.0 for the update. For more details on
how the release process works, visit <a href="http://git.idk.i2p/i2p-hackers/i2p.firefox">
the gitlab repository</a>.

in the next update. Please visit <a href="http://git.idk.i2p/i2p-hackers/i2p.firefox/issues">to
